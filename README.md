This project expands the capabilities of a binary tree data structure by adding attributes and methods that allow for advanced operations. The implemented features include checking the similarity between two binary trees, retrieving nodes at specific levels, calculating the height of the tree, and counting the total number of nodes, providing a comprehensive set of tools for binary tree manipulation and analysis.
